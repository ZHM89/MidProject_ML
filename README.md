# Midproject: Technical Exploration

## Welcome to the Midproject!
This project brings together model evaluation skills, technical storytelling, and data-driven insights. The goal is to build and understand machine learning models, draw meaningful conclusions, and communicate findings clearly.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on NBA player performance and salaries using a dataset from Kaggle: [Exploring NBA Player Performance and Salaries (2019)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/exploring-nba-player-performance-and-salaries-19). The analysis includes predictive modeling, business intelligence insights, and hypothesis testing.

## Project Focus Areas
- **Predictive Modeling / Machine Learning**
- **Business Intelligence or A/B Testing**
- **Research Question & Hypothesis Testing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as a foundation**

## Recommended Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset.
   - Document issues, missing values, and decisions.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand distributions, relationships, and data quality.
   - Form hypotheses and guide model selection.

3. **Modeling**
   - Train at least one machine learning model (classification or regression).
   - Discuss model choices, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.
   - Highlight limitations and challenges faced.

4. **Interpret Results**
   - Visualize insights, model performance, and key takeaways.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/exploring-nba-player-performance-and-salaries-19)
- Contains NBA player statistics and salary data from 2019.
- Features include player performance metrics, team details, and salary information.

## Deliverables
### Mandatory:
- **Technical Presentation (5–7 minutes):** Overview of findings, models, and challenges.
- **Dataset & Problem Definition:** Clearly define objectives and hypotheses.
- **Documented Data Preparation:** Cleaning steps, feature engineering, and assumptions.
- **Exploratory Insights:** At least 3 data visualizations to support analysis.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Train and evaluate at least one model, with a rationale for selection.
- **GitHub Repository:**
  - Clean, well-documented Python code (Jupyter Notebooks/scripts).
  - README explaining the project, methodology, and findings.

### Optional Enhancements:
- **Inferential Statistics:** t-tests, chi-square, correlation analysis, etc.
- **SQL Integration:** Data operations, cleaning, or feature engineering.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Tableau dashboards or Streamlit apps.
- **Automated Reporting:** Using Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit.

## Best Practices
- **Clean, Modular Code:** Use functions and maintain a clear structure.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Meaningful variable and file names.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Include comments, docstrings, and markdown explanations.
- **Git Usage:** Commit regularly, write meaningful messages, and maintain repository organization.
